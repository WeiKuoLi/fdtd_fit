more dipole per E field sampling

check gc average to 0

off resonance calculation as a check

gp calculation from absorption spectra

plasmon gauge is okay

phase sign of gcj is important or not

3 x 3 eff Hamiltonian does not care about gc phase but 4 x 4 non hermitian does care.  

gcj phase comes from field propagation from disk to mols. It might be important to discuss interference pattern comming from mols

bottom line gcj standard deviation is not real and its phase is crucial to the spectra when gvj is non zero
